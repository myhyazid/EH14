Earth Hour 2014 Countdown Timer for Websites.With HTML5 video player.

What is This?
====
This is a project from me(myhyazid) for encouraging all peoples especially those who have self hosted blogs and blogger(currently working) to temporarily use this HTML template as to show your support to Earth Hour Campaign year 2014 and later..

How can this project help to reduce co2 emissions produced?
====
Same like lights.But for blogs,it can rest the host server process awhile from huge internet traffic to come in.Imagine when there a lot of traffics come to your blogs,yes it brings many incomes for you.But the server has to work hard to process and it removes the heat produced in the server.The heat can give effects on Global Warming etc,.

Who can use this?
====
Everybody can use this but make sure to register your blogs at http://myhyazid.com .
The templates can be downloaded here or via myhyazid.com

Together We Support the Earth Hour Campaign for UNITING PEOPLE TO PROTECT THE PLANET.
